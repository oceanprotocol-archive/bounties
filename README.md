CALLING ALL BOUNTY HUNTERS! :moneybag: :money_with_wings: :gun:
---

Our goal is to keep growing and engaging our opensource dev community through bounties on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&keywords=oceanprotocol&order_by=-web3_created). Talk to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/oceanprotocol/Lobby)! Non-technical bounties can be found on [bounty.networks](https://explorer.bounties.network/explorer?bountyStage=active&platform=bounties-network&search=ocean).

#### How It Works?
We post bounties on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&keywords=oceanprotocol&order_by=-web3_created) via. this repository quite regularly. Instructions on how to complete the bounty will be included in the repository. The bounty will be awarded to the hunter who finishes within the deadline with the best solution. 

#### Types of Bounties?
We have a couple of different types of bounties, more info can be [found here](https://gitcoin.co/how/funder). Broadly speaking, we mostly run bounty contests, where-in we have multiple contributors who apply for the project, and the contributor with the best solution gets the bounty! However, even if it is a contest bounty, we will appropriately reward all valuable contributions. We greatly appreciate the value our open source community brings to Ocean and will always award some tokens to all great contributions! :smiley:

#### Questions and Reviews
Once the project has been completed, a pull request may be initiated in the repo specified in the project description. Pull requests will be reviewed by one of the maintainers or long-term contributors. In case of any additional questions feel free to ask [reach out to us!](https://gitter.im/oceanprotocol/Lobby) :)

#### Rewards and Payments
Once the project was reviewed and merged in the master branch, you will receive the reward. PROCN is a proto-Ocean token. Bounty hunters that earn PROCN will be able to convert them 1:1 to Ocean tokens on network launch (currently Ocean Token is valued at 0.20 EUR). Network launch is expected to happen by Mar 31, 2019. Until then PROCN will be locked and non-transferrable in the ETH wallet to which it is delivered to. 

#### Open Bounty
Notice a bug or have an idea for an interesting use case for Ocean Protocol? Feel free to reach out to us and if we think we can work together, we will definitely send some sweet tokens your way! For more, you can (see this post)[https://explorer.bounties.network/bounty/1407] or reach out to us.
