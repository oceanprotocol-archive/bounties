## We are very happy when


```
- This section is Definition of Done or conditions to be met to earn the bounty reward. 
- It should be a checklist mentioning each task in clear and concise way. 
- Keep ambiguity to minimum (ideally none).
- (e.g) if you want to have certain level of test coverage, use numbers like >95% and not 'high' test coverage.
- One of the task should be :
 [] Successful merge into the master/develop branch of the respective repo.
```

## Reward

This bounty is valued at `bounty reward` PROCN tokens. Once the project was reviewed and merged in the master branch, you will receive the reward. PROCN is a proto-Ocean token. Bounty hunters that earn PROCN will be able to convert them 1:1 to Ocean tokens on network launch (currently Ocean Token is valued at 0.20 EUR). Network launch is expected to happen by Mar 31, 2019. Until then PROCN will be locked and non-transferrable in the ETH wallet to which it is delivered to.
